								   <h1>History</h1> 
								   <article>
								       <p>
								        The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts (PCC) was founded in 1935 by James Adams and members of Local No. 274 as the Local’s social club.  Local No. 274 was Philadelphia’s African American musicians union.  At a time when the city’s African American  musicians struggled for political, economic and cultural recognition, Local No. 274 gave them representation and broke a tradition of segregation.

								        It was not unusual to see Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Art Blakely, Dinah Washington, Max Roach and others exchanging jazz ideas in the hallways of the club.  The PCC eventually became a haven for jazz lovers, who would pack the club on weekends and watch celebrities as they made their flashy entrances. The PCC became so popular that it created a “B” membership for jazz lovers and out-of-town musicians

								        The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts is the first facility ever constructed specifically as a jazz institution – a testament to our nation’s history.
