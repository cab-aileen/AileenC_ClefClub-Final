								   <h1>History</h1> 
								   <article>
								       <p>
								        The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts (PCC) was founded in 1935 by James Adams and members of Local No. 274 as the Local’s social club.  Local No. 274 was Philadelphia’s African American musicians union.  At a time when the city’s African American  musicians struggled for political, economic and cultural recognition, Local No. 274 gave them representation and broke a tradition of segregation.

								        It was not unusual to see Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Art Blakely, Dinah Washington, Max Roach and others exchanging jazz ideas in the hallways of the club.  The PCC eventually became a haven for jazz lovers, who would pack the club on weekends and watch celebrities as they made their flashy entrances. The PCC became so popular that it created a “B” membership for jazz lovers and out-of-town musicians

										    <h1>Education</h1>
										    <article>
										        <p>
										            One of the great facts about jazz is that it bridges generations. Jazz relies on interactive improvisation and live performance, and thus can’t completely be taught in a classroom or with a book, aspiring younger musicians seek the direct guidance of older, wiser ones. Mentorship is crucial when passing on artistic genre to youth so the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz sees the component as a vital variable of its programs.  Mentoring fosters substantive one-to-one communications between student musicians and experienced master-level professionals.

										                This program is the standard grouping of youth who learn and perform together based on skill level.  Youth are assessed by instructors who will consider age and maturity before placing students into one of the following ensembles: junior-level for beginners, intermediate level, and senior level for more skilled players.  Once assigned an ensemble, youth are taught jazz compositions that are in line with their group capacities.  As students improve they may progress to more advanced ensembles groups.
