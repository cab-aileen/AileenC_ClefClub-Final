            One of the great facts about jazz is that it bridges generations. Jazz relies on interactive improvisation and live performance, and thus can’t completely be taught in a classroom or with a book, aspiring younger musicians seek the direct guidance of older, wiser ones. Mentorship is crucial when passing on artistic genre to youth so the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz sees the component as a vital variable of its programs.  Mentoring fosters substantive one-to-one communications between student musicians and experienced master-level professionals.

                This program is the standard grouping of youth who learn and perform together based on skill level.  Youth are assessed by instructors who will consider age and maturity before placing students into one of the following ensembles: junior-level for beginners, intermediate level, and senior level for more skilled players.  Once assigned an ensemble, youth are taught jazz compositions that are in line with their group capacities.  As students improve they may progress to more advanced ensembles groups.

                Mentorship:  Enables students interested in jazz to learn from the past while bringing the music into the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                For students with limited opportunities for private lessons and exposure to working jazz artists, a master class can be particularly inspiring and motivating. The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz & Performing Arts places a strong emphasis on master classes, which bring leading jazz practitioners into the classroom to perform, teach, answer questions and offer guidance, both musical and personal. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our master classes provide student musicians with outstanding opportunities to learn from and be mentored by top jazz players, Philadelphia Clef Club faculty and visiting artists. The master artist often focuses on common topics: improvisation, ensemble playing, practice techniques, the creative process, and ways to improve performance.
