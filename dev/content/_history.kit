        The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts (PCC) was founded in 1935 by James Adams and members of Local No. 274 as the Local’s social club.  Local No. 274 was Philadelphia’s African American musicians union.

        It was not unusual to see Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Art Blakely, Dinah Washington, Max Roach and others exchanging jazz ideas in the hallways of the club.

The PCC became so popular that it created a “B” membership for jazz lovers and out-of-town musicians
